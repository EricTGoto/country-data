# Country Data

<b>Background</b>

This is a project to practice creating a React app, and in particular, fetching data in a React app. In this app, I fetch country data from restcountries.com's all country API and weather data from openweathermap.org. I also practice installing libraries for production and dev. The libraries I have installed for this project are axios and ESLint. I also practice breaking down the different parts of the app into components as that is a key part of creating apps in React.
